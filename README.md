How to get sample Cisco commands using APIs.

Connected to cisco Nexus device using APIs. Run some samples commands and the interface gives the data in json format. 

Nexus API is an API client. NX-API REST brings Model Driven Programmability (MDP) to standalone (non-APIC-based fabric) Nexus family switches. In model-driven architectures, software maintains a complete, explicit representation of the administrative and operational state of the system (the model) and performs actions only as side-effects of mutations of model entities.

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. 

Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:

GET: Obtain information 

POST: Add information

PUT: Replace information

PATCH: Update certain information

DELETE: Delete information
